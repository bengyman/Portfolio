          Ever since I was a kid in primary school, I've always had a knack for coding. I joined the Robotics Club, where I had my first taste of coding and developed a passion for technology. I also won many robotics competitions with my team. This early exposure laid the foundation for my future endeavors in the tech world.

          In secondary school, I began learning the basics of Python and HTML, further fueling my interest in programming. These foundational skills opened up a world of possibilities and inspired me to dive deeper into web development and software engineering.

          After secondary school, I decided to pursue my passion for coding more seriously by enrolling in Nanyang Polytechnic, where I am currently studying for a diploma in Information Technology.
